 1   Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a
     suffix that can be tracked to it's assignment? Why do some variables
     have a suffix `(D)'?

Ans- In SSA file i noticed a underscore in front of variable.Maybe (D) means it's missing
     a definition



 2   Find the point in the CFG in  which the paths of the two assignments
     to variable `a'  and `b' merge. You will notice  that PHI statements
     have  been  introduced.  Can  you   guess  the  syntax  of  the  PHI
     statements?

Ans-Syntax of phi statements is probably PHI < prec_1, prec_2, ... prec_n > where
    prec_i is name(bb) - name being the name of the variable and bb the number of
    the basic block in which it was declared.
  


3   Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two
    versions of a variable?

Ans-3. This could come from a switch statement or cascading if-else blocks.
