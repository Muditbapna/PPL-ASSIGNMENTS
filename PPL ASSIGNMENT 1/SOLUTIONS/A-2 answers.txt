 1   How have if-blocks  been translated into GIMPLE  statements? Can you
     differentiate between conditional and unconditional gotos?

Ans- If-blocks are turned into conditional gotos to labels. Unconditional gotos
     are a goto by themselves on a line. Conditional gotos always have two labels
     for the if and else branches.



2    Repeat  the  above compilation,  but  now  asking for  another  dump
     that  of  the pass  "cfg".  View  this  pass  and say  whether  this
     representation makes it easier to  read and understand GIMPLEs. Draw
     the control-flow graph  of the program A-2.c on a  piece of paper by
     looking at the CFG dump.

Ans- It's a bit easier to see the control flow in this representation, but
     consumes more  number of lines and hence is less compact.
