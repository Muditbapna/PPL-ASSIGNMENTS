1  Identify the basic blocks that correspond  to the while loop. How is
   the GIMPLE for a while loop different from simple if-else jumps?
 
Ans-bb 3 and bb 4 correspond to the while loop. bb2 avoids executing an iteration
   unconditionally by having an unconditional goto to bb4 which is the while
   loop conditional. This is different from the if-else jumps, which always seem
   to be conditional.



2. Identify the  basic blocks  for the nested  for-loop. You  should be
   able  to identify  intializers, conditions  and increments  for each
   loop as  well as  the shared  inner body.  Is there  really anything
   special about a for-loop as compared to a while-loop?

Ans-bb 5:  Outer loop  variable initialisation
    bb 10: Outer loop condition check
    bb 6:  Inner loop variable initialisation
    bb 8:  Inner loop condition check
    bb 7:  Inner loop body + inner loop variable increment
    bb 9:  Outer loop  variable increment
