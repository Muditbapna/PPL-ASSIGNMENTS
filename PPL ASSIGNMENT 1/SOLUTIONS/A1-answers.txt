 1   How  do the  declarations  look in  the  GIMPLE? Specifically,  what
     happens to multiple  variables declared and initialized  on the same
     line? What happens to global declaration [int Z]?

Ans- In the gimple IR file of thw given code each declaration is made on a new line.
     Multiple declarations given on the same line are converted to seperate declarations 
     on new lines.The global variable is not declared along with other variables,instead
     whenevwr it is required in an expression it,s value is stored in another temporary 
     variable and later assigned to the global variable.



2    How are complex  expressions such as [c  = a * b +  25] broken down?
     Can you  determine a  rule as  to when  temporary variables  will be
     introduced?

Ans- The whole expression is broken down in terms. Then one term is evaluated and its value
     is stored in a temporary variable.then further evaluation is done using the temporary
     variable and finally the expression is stored back to the originally declared variable.The
     rule for evaluation of expression seems to be that expressions are stored in temporary 
     variable as compiler performs one action at a timr and then they are used for further 
     evaluation and final value is stored back to the original variable.



3    How are  floats/doubles represented in  GIMPLE? What happens  when a
     float/double is assigned to an integer in [Z = r]?

Ans- Floats and doubles are represented using scientific notation. The double data type is 
     coverted to int and then it is assigned to z as z is an int data type
     


4    How  are reads/writes  to the  global variable  Z performed?  Why is
     there a temporary introduced  for the statement [Z = Z  + 1] but not
     for the statements [q = Z] or [Z = p]?

Ans- Reads/writes to z performed through loads to/stores from locals. A temporary
     is required for Z = Z + 1 because in gimple only one operation can be done in
     one step so assignment and increment both cant be done in a single command hence temporay variables are used
