 1  How is array declaration and initialization handled?

Ans-Arrays  are declared in a single statement with no initialisation and required
    size. Initialisation takes place one element per statement .



2.  Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with
    an intermediate temporary?

Ans- Because  only one memory operation per instruction is permitted. Read
    and write cannot be performed simultaneously as array access includes calculation
    of memory address. 


3.   Why are cobblers used?

Ans-As arrays are traversed by calculation of subsquent memory location and accesing
    the datatype at that locations. Hence in order to mark the end of scope of these arrays
